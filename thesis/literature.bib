	abstract = {After introducing key concepts and definitions in the field of digital identity, this paper will investigate the benefits and drawbacks of existing identity systems on the road towards achieving self-sovereign identity. It will explore, in particular, the use of blockchain technology and biometrics as a means to ensure the {\textquotedblleft}unicity{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}singularity{\textquotedblright} of identities, and the associated challenges pertaining to the security and confidentiality of personal information. The paper will then propose a model of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity based on attestations, claims, credentials and permissions, which is globally portable across the life of an individual. Such a system is not dependent on any particular government or organization for administration or legitimacy, although it might include government issued identification and biometrics as one of many indicia of identity. Such a solution based on a recorded and signed digital history of actions is a system that best approximates the fluidity and granularity of identity, enabling individuals to express only specific facets of their identity, depending on the parties with whom they wish to interact. This paper focuses on two case studies to explain how such a credentials system could work in specific contexts: (1) Kiva{\textquoteright}s identity protocol for building credit history in Sierra Leone, and (2) World Food Programme{\textquoteright}s Building Blocks program for delivering cash aid to refugees in Jordan. Finally, the paper will explore what the future might look like when blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and self-sovereign identity intersect. With digital transactions functioning as identity claims within an ecosystem based on self-sovereign identity, new business models might emerge, such as identity insurance schemes, along with the emergence of value-stable cryptocurrencies ({\textquotedblleft}stablecoins{\textquotedblright}) functioning as local currencies.},

Blockchain is an enabling technology for building self-sovereign identity systems by providing a neutral and trustable storage and computing infrastructure, and can be viewed as a component of the systems. Both blockchain and self-sovereign identity are emerging technologies which could present a steep learning curve for architects. We collect and propose 12 design patterns for blockchainbased self-sovereign identity systems to help the architects understand and easily apply the concepts in system design. Based on the lifecycles of three main objects involved in self-sovereign identity, we categorise the patterns into three groups: key management patterns, decentralised identifier management patterns, and credential design patterns. The proposed patterns provide a systematic and holistic guide for architects to design the architecture of blockchainbased self-sovereign identity systems.},

However, there is a lack of systematic architecture designs for blockchain-based SSI systems to support methodical development. An aspect of such gap is demonstrated in current solutions, which are considered coarse grained and may increase data security risks. In this paper, we first identify the lifecycles of three major SSI objects (i.e., key, identifier, and credential) and present fine-grained design patterns critical for application development. These patterns are associated with particular state transitions, providing a systematic view of system interactions and serving as a guidance for effective use of these patterns. Further, we present an SSI platform architecture, which advocates the notion of Design-Pattern-as-a-Service. Each design pattern serves as an API by wrapping the respective pattern code to ease application development and improve scalability and security. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on feasibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the role of digital identities for a functioning digital economy and outlines requirements for their management. So far, no approach for the management of digital identities has been widely established, which leads to a fragmentation of ID services as well as a variety of user accounts. Due to the lack of standards, the interoperability of digital identities is also limited. This leads to several problems that prevent the efficient and secure handling of digital identities. The concept of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and the associated standards {\textquotedblleft}Verifiable Credentials{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}Decentralized Identifiers{\textquotedblright} is a promising approach to improve the situation. They allow the flexible exchange of tamper-proof digital proofs between users and systems. Therefore, they form the foundation for building trust relationships in the digital space. This paper introduces the SSI paradigm and discusses the barriers that prevent the wide-scale adoption of this concept. With that, the reader gets a compact overview of different approaches for identity management and the potentials of self-sovereign identities. For the design of digital services in business and administration, this approach should be given greater attention to benefit from the associated advantages.},

	abstract = {In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an influential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.},

	abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things applications are distributed Cyber-Physical systems with long life-cycles, with strict security requirements, that are being pervasively adopted with the proliferation of Industry 4.0. A fundamental aspect of security, in such applications, is a trustworthy identity to avoid impersonation attacks. Classical approaches for identity management usually rely on some variation of a centralized system, either based in a Public Key Infrastructure or in a central identity database. These solutions have some well-known drawbacks, notably the single point of failure in the central node and the limited scalability. Self-Sovereign Identity is a novel paradigm for digital identity allowing individuals and devices to fully own and manage their digital identities. According to this paradigm, identity artifacts can be stored by their owners and freely presented whenever a transaction requires some proof of identity, without relying on a central entity. This paper provides a review and discussion of the use-cases, technologies, and challenges that Self-Sovereign Identity faces in the context of Industrial Internet of Things{\textquoteright} applications. The potential advantages of using this new paradigm are discussed in detail, together with the key challenges that still need to be addressed.},

Digital identities have traditionally been used as a way of authenticating to the computer systems at work, or a personal online service, such as an email. Today, our physical existence has a digital counterpart that became an integral part of everyday life. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the next step in the evolution of the digital identity management systems. The blockchain technology and distributed ledgers have provided necessary building blocks and facilities, that bring us closer to the realisation of an ideal Self-Sovereign Identity. But what exactly is an ideal Self-Sovereign Identity? What are the characteristics? Trade-o?s? Here, we propose the framework and methodology that can be used to evaluate, describe, and compare SSI systems. Based on our comparison criteria and the evaluation framework, we present a systematic analytical study of existing SSI systems: uPort, Sovrin, ShoCard, Civic, and Blockstack.},

However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology.

With respect to the various data breaches and privacy regulations, the current identity solutions are not fully optimized. In this paper, we will take a look at several Self-Sovereign Identity solutions which are already available. Some of them are built upon blockchain technology as this already provides decentralized persistent data and consensus. We will explore the emerging landscape of SelfSovereign Identity solutions and dissect their implementations under multiple aspect criteria to determine the necessity of blockchain technology in this field. We conclude that blockchain technology is not explicitly required for a Self-Sovereign Identity solution but it is a good foundation to build up on, due to various technical advantages that the blockchain has to offer.},

This paradigm focuses on user-centricity and strives to place the user in full control of the digital identity. Numerous implementations embrace the self-sovereign identity concept, leading to a fragmented landscape of solutions. At the same time, traditional identity and access management protocols are largely disregarded and facilities to issue verifiable claims as attributes are not available. Therefore, service providers barely adopt these solutions. We propose a component-based architecture for integrating selfsovereign identity solutions into web applications to foster their adoption by service providers. Furthermore, we outline a sample implementation as a gateway that enables uPort and Jolocom for authentication, via the OpenID Connect protocol, as well as the retrieval of email address attestations for these solutions.},

            Self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions implemented on the basis of blockchain technology are seen as alternatives to existing digital identification systems, or even as a foundation of standards for the new global infrastructures for identity management systems. It is argued that {\textquoteleft}self-sovereignty' in this context can be understood as the concept of individual control over identity relevant private data, capacity to choose where such data is stored, and the ability to provide it to those who need to validate it. It is also argued that while it might be appealing to operationalise the concept of {\textquoteleft}self-sovereignty{\textquoteright} in a narrow technical sense, depreciation of moral semantics obscures key challenges and long-term repercussions. Closer attention to the normative substance of the {\textquoteleft}sovereignty{\textquoteright} concept helps to highlight a range of ethical issues pertaining to the changing nature of human identity in the context of ubiquitous private data collection.},
