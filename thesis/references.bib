	abstract = {Secure decentralized namespaces have recently become possible due to cryptocurrency technol-ogy. They enable a censorship-resistant domain-name system outside the control of any single en-tity, among other applications. Namecoin, a fork of Bitcoin, is the most prominent example. We initiate the study of decentralized names-paces and the market for names in such systems. Our extensive empirical analysis of Namecoin re-veals a system in disrepair. Indeed, our methodol-ogy for detecting “squatted ” and otherwise inactive domains reveals that among Namecoin’s roughly 120,000 registered domain names, a mere 28 are not squatted and have nontrivial content. Further, we develop techniques for detecting transfers of do-mains in the Namecoin block chain and provide evidence that the market for domains is thin-to-nonexistent. We argue that the state of the art in mecha-nism design for decentralized namespace markets is lacking. We propose a model of utility of differ-ent names to different participants, and articulate desiderata of a decentralized namespace in terms of this utility function. We use this model to ex-plore the design space of mechanisms and analyze the trade-offs. 1},

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a set of technologies that move control of digital identity from third party “identity providers” directly to individuals, and it promises to be one of the most important trends for the coming decades. Now in Self-Sovereign Identity, privacy and personal data experts Drummond Reed and Alex Preukschat lay out a roadmap for a future of personal sovereignty powered by the Blockchain and cryptography. Cutting through the technical jargon with dozens of practical use cases from experts across all major industries, it presents a clear and compelling argument for why SSI is a paradigm shift, and shows how you can be ready to be prepared for it.},

While all of these initiatives share a reliance on APIs for the facilitation of a sound and effective data sharing ecosystem, they vary in terms of rationale, scope and implementation. Furthermore, data sharing via APIs requires a complex implementation process, and technicalities are crucial for their success. Moreover, an excessive reliance on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms might be overestimated when it comes to data compensation, as has been demonstrated by the continuing saga involving standard essential patents.},

Overall, 73\% of participants were affected by at least one breach, 5.36 breaches on average. Many participants attributed the cause of being affected by a breach to their poor email and security practices; only 14\% correctly attributed the cause to external factors such as breached organizations and hackers. Participants were unaware of 74\% of displayed breaches and expressed various emotions when learning about them. While some reported intending to take action, most participants believed the breach would not impact them. Our ﬁndings underline the need for user-friendly tools to improve consumers’ resilience against breaches and accountability for breached organizations to provide more proactive post-breach communications and mitigations.},

While device fragmentation – multiple, only partly compatible versions of a platform – has been complicating matters already, the need to target diﬀerent device classes is a new emergence. Smartphones and tablets are relatively similar but app-enabled devices such as TVs and even cars typically have diﬀering capabilities. To facilitate usage of cross-platform app development approaches, we present work on an evaluation framework. Our framework provides a set of up-todate evaluation criteria. Unlike prior work on this topic, it oﬀers weighted assessment to cater for varieties in targeted device classes. Besides motivating and explaining the evaluation criteria, we present an exemplary application for one development approach and, as benchmarks, for native apps and Webapps. Our ﬁndings suggest that the proliferation of appenabled devices ampliﬁes the need for improved development support.},

Most tools that are developed at university research labs are described in some detail in books, articles, or technical reports. However, there is a need for objective information on commercial software tools for building expert systems. These tools can be used for research, prototyping and developing end-user applications. Necessarily we must establish a set of criteria which can be used to evaluate these tools. These criteria include an evaluation of the basicfeatures, the development environment, what a tool can be usedfor, how easy it is to learn and use, how much it costs, and how it is supported. In thefirstpart of this paper, a set of criteria is describedfor evaluating expert system software tools.

	abstract = {Digital identity is the key element of digital transformation in representing any real-world entity in the digital form. To ensure a successful digital future the requirement for an effective digital identity is paramount, especially as demand increases for digital services. Several Identity Management (IDM) systems are developed to cope with identity effectively, nonetheless, existing IDM systems have some limitations corresponding to identity and its management such as sovereignty, storage and access control, security, privacy and safeguarding, all of which require further improvement. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging IDM system which incorporates several required features to ensure that identity is sovereign, secure, reliable and generic. It is an evolving IDM system, thus it is essential to analyse its various features to determine its effectiveness in coping with the dynamic requirements of identity and its current challenges. This paper proposes numerous governing principles of SSI to analyse any SSI ecosystem and its effectiveness. Later, based on the proposed governing principles of SSI, it performs a comparative analysis of the two most popular SSI ecosystems uPort and Sovrin to present their effectiveness and limitations.},

This led to a new cloud security service paradigm called identity and access management (IAM) service, IDentity-as-a-Service (IDaaS). Many IAM standards have been proposed in the last two decades: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Central Authentication Service (CAS), OZ Protocol, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), CoSign Protocol, Open Authentication (OAuth), and OpenID Connect (OIDC). However, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) IAM requirements are somewhat different due to its resource limitations and mobile communication. It may not be necessary that the same IAM standards are equally effective for MCC. To determine the appropriateness of these IAM standards for MCC requires some IAM performance evaluation criteria. Therefore, this paper proposes several evaluation criteria for an effective IAM standard for MCC.},

	abstract = {Managing identity across an ever-growing digital services landscape has become one of the most challenging tasks for security experts. Over the years, several Identity Management (IDM) systems were introduced and adopted to tackle with the growing demand of an identity. In this series, a recently emerging IDM system is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) which offers greater control and access to users regarding their identity. This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efﬁciency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system. Secondly, it develops a Decentralized Application (DApp) to demonstrate and evaluate its operational services and efﬁciency. Finally, based on the developed DApp and experimental analysis, it presents the advantages and limitations of the uPort identity management system.},

	abstract = {Identity is a crucial property of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to rapid growth and high numbers of similar devices, reliable identification of those devices is a problem. The origin and history of an IoT device is especially important in security-relevant environments. Our research addresses this issue by proposing an approach based on blockchain and decentralised identifiers (DID). It is inspired by the concepts of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and bootstrapping of remote secure key infrastructures (BRSKI). Devices are equipped by the manufacturer with an identity stored in a trusted execution environment (TEE) and secured by a blockchain. This identity can be used to trace back the origin of the device. During the bootstrapping process on the customer side, the identity registration of the device is updated in the blockchain. This process is performed by a so-called registrar. Smart contracts prevent unsolicited transfer of ownership and track the history of the device. Besides proof of origin and device security our concept can be used for device inventory and firmware upgrade.},

A fundamental aspect of security, in such applications, is a trustworthy identity to avoid impersonation attacks. Classical approaches for identity management usually rely on some variation of a centralized system, either based in a Public Key Infrastructure or in a central identity database. These solutions have some well-known drawbacks, notably the single point of failure in the central node and the limited scalability. Self-Sovereign Identity is a novel paradigm for digital identity allowing individuals and devices to fully own and manage their digital identities. According to this paradigm, identity artifacts can be stored by their owners and freely presented whenever a transaction requires some proof of identity, without relying on a central entity. This paper provides a review and discussion of the use-cases, technologies, and challenges that Self-Sovereign Identity faces in the context of Industrial Internet of Things’ applications. The potential advantages of using this new paradigm are discussed in detail, together with the key challenges that still need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {The Internet today lacks an identity protocol for identifying people and organizations. As a result, service providers needed to build and maintain their own databases of user information. This solution is costly to the service providers, inefficient as much of the information is duplicated across different providers, difficult to secure as evidenced by recent large-scale personal data breaches around the world, and cumbersome to the users who need to remember different sets of credentials for different services. Furthermore, personal information could be collected for data mining, profiling and exploitation without users' knowledge or consent. The ideal solution would be self-sovereign identity, a new form of identity management that is owned and controlled entirely by each individual user. This solution would include the individual's consolidated digital identity as well as their set of verified attributes that have been cryptographically signed by various trusted issuers. The individual provides proof of identity and membership by sharing relevant parts of their identity with the service providers. Consent for access may also be revoked hence giving the individual full control over its own data. This survey critically investigates different blockchain based identity management and authentication frameworks. A summary of the state-of-the-art blockchain based identity management and authentication solutions from year 2014 to 2018 is presented. The paper concludes with the open issues, main challenges and directions highlighted for future work in this area. In a nutshell, the discovery of this new mechanism disrupted the existing identity management and authentication solutions and by providing a more promising secure platform.},

The Rigor Cycle provides grounding theories and methods along with domain experience and expertise from the foundations knowledge base into the research and adds the new knowledge generated by the research to the growing knowledge base. The central Design Cycle supports a tighter loop of research activity for the construction and evaluation of design artifacts and processes. The recognition of these three cycles in a research project clearly positions and differentiates design science from other research paradigms. The commentary concludes with a claim to the pragmatic nature of design science.},

            Self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions implemented on the basis of blockchain technology are seen as alternatives to existing digital identification systems, or even as a foundation of standards for the new global infrastructures for identity management systems. It is argued that ‘self-sovereignty' in this context can be understood as the concept of individual control over identity relevant private data, capacity to choose where such data is stored, and the ability to provide it to those who need to validate it. It is also argued that while it might be appealing to operationalise the concept of ‘self-sovereignty’ in a narrow technical sense, depreciation of moral semantics obscures key challenges and long-term repercussions. Closer attention to the normative substance of the ‘sovereignty’ concept helps to highlight a range of ethical issues pertaining to the changing nature of human identity in the context of ubiquitous private data collection.},

	abstract = {Digital identity is the key element of digital transformation in representing any real-world entity in the digital form. To ensure a successful digital future the requirement for an effective digital identity is paramount, especially as demand increases for digital services. Several Identity Management (IDM) systems are developed to cope with identity effectively, nonetheless, existing IDM systems have some limitations corresponding to identity and its management such as sovereignty, storage and access control, security, privacy and safeguarding, all of which require further improvement. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging IDM system which incorporates several required features to ensure that identity is sovereign, secure, reliable and generic. It is an evolving IDM system, thus it is essential to analyse its various features to determine its effectiveness in coping with the dynamic requirements of identity and its current challenges. This paper proposes numerous governing principles of SSI to analyse any SSI ecosystem and its effectiveness. Later, based on the proposed governing principles of SSI, it performs a comparative analysis of the two most popular SSI ecosystems uPort and Sovrin to present their effectiveness and limitations.},

The significantly high prices of digital currencies and initial coin offerings as the new funding approach has fostered the public perception of blockchain as a cure-all and driven the hype even further. In this evolution, a clear view of the reasonable application of blockchain technology is not given and therefore, the purposeful use of traditional technologies is undermined. To clarify this situation, we derive a novel decision model for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology that considers two key factors: the remediation of central governance and the management of digital objects. Based on these key factors, we closely analyse the domain of identity management for conscious blockchain application. Finally, we examine uPort, Sovrin, and ShoCard as distinct projects in this scope with regard to the inevitable necessity to implement a blockchain by using our decision model.},

In this paper, we ﬁrst identify the lifecycles of three major SSI objects (i.e., key, identiﬁer, and credential) and present ﬁne-grained design patterns critical for application development. These patterns are associated with particular state transitions, providing a systematic view of system interactions and serving as a guidance for effective use of these patterns. Further, we present an SSI platform architecture, which advocates the notion of Design-Pattern-as-a-Service. Each design pattern serves as an API by wrapping the respective pattern code to ease application development and improve scalability and security.

Both blockchain and self-sovereign identity are emerging technologies which could present a steep learning curve for architects. We collect and propose 12 design patterns for blockchainbased self-sovereign identity systems to help the architects understand and easily apply the concepts in system design. Based on the lifecycles of three main objects involved in self-sovereign identity, we categorise the patterns into three groups: key management patterns, decentralised identifier management patterns, and credential design patterns.

However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS.},

	abstract = {In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an inﬂuential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the ﬁrst-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned ﬂows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the ﬁrst formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.},

	abstract = {After introducing key concepts and definitions in the field of digital identity, this paper will investigate the benefits and drawbacks of existing identity systems on the road towards achieving self-sovereign identity. It will explore, in particular, the use of blockchain technology and biometrics as a means to ensure the “unicity” and “singularity” of identities, and the associated challenges pertaining to the security and confidentiality of personal information. The paper will then propose a model of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity based on attestations, claims, credentials and permissions, which is globally portable across the life of an individual. Such a system is not dependent on any particular government or organization for administration or legitimacy, although it might include government issued identification and biometrics as one of many indicia of identity. Such a solution based on a recorded and signed digital history of actions is a system that best approximates the fluidity and granularity of identity, enabling individuals to express only specific facets of their identity, depending on the parties with whom they wish to interact. This paper focuses on two case studies to explain how such a credentials system could work in specific contexts: (1) Kiva’s identity protocol for building credit history in Sierra Leone, and (2) World Food Programme’s Building Blocks program for delivering cash aid to refugees in Jordan. Finally, the paper will explore what the future might look like when blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and self-sovereign identity intersect. With digital transactions functioning as identity claims within an ecosystem based on self-sovereign identity, new business models might emerge, such as identity insurance schemes, along with the emergence of value-stable cryptocurrencies (“stablecoins”) functioning as local currencies.},

Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues, such as enabling mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in blockchain architectures, governance models, and other salient features. Context is provided for the taxonomy through the description of related terms, emerging standards, and use cases while highlighting relevant security and privacy considerations.},

	url = {http://essay.utwente.nl/71274/},
	abstract = {With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes. In this research we will explore the possibility of self-sovereign identity, where you are in control of your digital identity. We started with a desk research on currently available identity man agement solutions. We concluded that in most systems, the end-user is not able to store their own data. Currently only one decentralized system is available, but has not gained wide adoption yet. A case study has been performed on a solution which allows the ex change of KYC attributes, resulting from thorough Customer Due Dili gence (CDD) as is often performed when opening a bank account. These attributes can be used by other entities, like insurance companies and mortgage lenders to make their on-boarding process easier for customers, since they don't need to supply copies of the same documentation all over again. Also, the companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) this way to lower costs and make fewer errors. Al though the idea is very interesting, the studied solution did not meet the expectations. At the time the company behind the solution was very small and the process to improve very complex. The solution was also propri etary, creating dependence on the vendor, which heightens the adoption barrier. Because of the lessons learned from the case study, the results of the literature research and the desk research, we designed an architecture for a Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) using the concept of claim-based identity and blockchain technology. To lower adoption barriers and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, it will be developed on a public blockchain and source code will be made open-source. The solution will be privacy-friendly by using privacy-enhancing techniques and storing only claims about one's identity. We also provide a solution to allow retrieval of more sensitive data, and made it as modular as possible to make integration within existing IT architecture easier. The Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) can be use ful in a wide range of use cases, like proving your age when buying liquor at the supermarket or applying for a health insurance where you get a student discount if you can show your are enrolled at a university. This shows that our work resulted in a solid foundation for self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.},

Therefore, service providers barely adopt these solutions. We propose a component-based architecture for integrating selfsovereign identity solutions into web applications to foster their adoption by service providers. Furthermore, we outline a sample implementation as a gateway that enables uPort and Jolocom for authentication, via the OpenID Connect protocol, as well as the retrieval of email address attestations for these solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the role of digital identities for a functioning digital economy and outlines requirements for their management. So far, no approach for the management of digital identities has been widely established, which leads to a fragmentation of ID services as well as a variety of user accounts. Due to the lack of standards, the interoperability of digital identities is also limited. This leads to several problems that prevent the efﬁcient and secure handling of digital identities. The concept of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and the associated standards “Veriﬁable Credentials” and “Decentralized Identiﬁers” is a promising approach to improve the situation. They allow the ﬂexible exchange of tamper-proof digital proofs between users and systems. Therefore, they form the foundation for building trust relationships in the digital space. This paper introduces the SSI paradigm and discusses the barriers that prevent the wide-scale adoption of this concept. With that, the reader gets a compact overview of different approaches for identity management and the potentials of self-sovereign identities. For the design of digital services in business and administration, this approach should be given greater attention to beneﬁt from the associated advantages.},
