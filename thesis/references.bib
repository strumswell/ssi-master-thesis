	abstract = {Identity is a crucial property of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to rapid growth and high numbers of similar devices, reliable identification of those devices is a problem. The origin and history of an IoT device is especially important in security-relevant environments. Our research addresses this issue by proposing an approach based on blockchain and decentralised identifiers (DID). It is inspired by the concepts of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and bootstrapping of remote secure key infrastructures (BRSKI). Devices are equipped by the manufacturer with an identity stored in a trusted execution environment (TEE) and secured by a blockchain. This identity can be used to trace back the origin of the device. During the bootstrapping process on the customer side, the identity registration of the device is updated in the blockchain. This process is performed by a so-called registrar. Smart contracts prevent unsolicited transfer of ownership and track the history of the device. Besides proof of origin and device security our concept can be used for device inventory and firmware upgrade.},

In recent years, there have been attempts to introduce blockchain-based identity management solutions, which allow the user to take over control of his/her own identity (i.e. self-sovereign identity). In this paper, we provide an in-depth review of existing blockchain-based identity management papers and patents published between May 2017 and January 2020. Based on the analysis of the literature, we identify potential research gaps and opportunities, which will hopefully help inform future research agenda.},

A fundamental aspect of security, in such applications, is a trustworthy identity to avoid impersonation attacks. Classical approaches for identity management usually rely on some variation of a centralized system, either based in a Public Key Infrastructure or in a central identity database. These solutions have some well-known drawbacks, notably the single point of failure in the central node and the limited scalability. Self-Sovereign Identity is a novel paradigm for digital identity allowing individuals and devices to fully own and manage their digital identities. According to this paradigm, identity artifacts can be stored by their owners and freely presented whenever a transaction requires some proof of identity, without relying on a central entity. This paper provides a review and discussion of the use-cases, technologies, and challenges that Self-Sovereign Identity faces in the context of Industrial Internet of Things’ applications. The potential advantages of using this new paradigm are discussed in detail, together with the key challenges that still need to be addressed.},

The private or consortium blockchain is more suitable for identity system which will be used for university.

The existing identity systems are not well fixed with the university identity management system really needs, especially; they remain needing the relevant issue of effective consent revocation. The appendonly storage of blockchain can be a barrier for implementing the revocability of consent. Some private blockchain based system has the potential vendor lock-in effects.

	abstract = {The Internet today lacks an identity protocol for identifying people and organizations. As a result, service providers needed to build and maintain their own databases of user information. This solution is costly to the service providers, inefficient as much of the information is duplicated across different providers, difficult to secure as evidenced by recent large-scale personal data breaches around the world, and cumbersome to the users who need to remember different sets of credentials for different services. Furthermore, personal information could be collected for data mining, profiling and exploitation without users' knowledge or consent. The ideal solution would be self-sovereign identity, a new form of identity management that is owned and controlled entirely by each individual user. This solution would include the individual's consolidated digital identity as well as their set of verified attributes that have been cryptographically signed by various trusted issuers. The individual provides proof of identity and membership by sharing relevant parts of their identity with the service providers. Consent for access may also be revoked hence giving the individual full control over its own data. This survey critically investigates different blockchain based identity management and authentication frameworks. A summary of the state-of-the-art blockchain based identity management and authentication solutions from year 2014 to 2018 is presented. The paper concludes with the open issues, main challenges and directions highlighted for future work in this area. In a nutshell, the discovery of this new mechanism disrupted the existing identity management and authentication solutions and by providing a more promising secure platform.},

            Self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions implemented on the basis of blockchain technology are seen as alternatives to existing digital identification systems, or even as a foundation of standards for the new global infrastructures for identity management systems. It is argued that ‘self-sovereignty' in this context can be understood as the concept of individual control over identity relevant private data, capacity to choose where such data is stored, and the ability to provide it to those who need to validate it. It is also argued that while it might be appealing to operationalise the concept of ‘self-sovereignty’ in a narrow technical sense, depreciation of moral semantics obscures key challenges and long-term repercussions. Closer attention to the normative substance of the ‘sovereignty’ concept helps to highlight a range of ethical issues pertaining to the changing nature of human identity in the context of ubiquitous private data collection.},

The significantly high prices of digital currencies and initial coin offerings as the new funding approach has fostered the public perception of blockchain as a cure-all and driven the hype even further. In this evolution, a clear view of the reasonable application of blockchain technology is not given and therefore, the purposeful use of traditional technologies is undermined. To clarify this situation, we derive a novel decision model for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology that considers two key factors: the remediation of central governance and the management of digital objects. Based on these key factors, we closely analyse the domain of identity management for conscious blockchain application. Finally, we examine uPort, Sovrin, and ShoCard as distinct projects in this scope with regard to the inevitable necessity to implement a blockchain by using our decision model.},

	abstract = {Digital identity is the key element of digital transformation in representing any real-world entity in the digital form. To ensure a successful digital future the requirement for an effective digital identity is paramount, especially as demand increases for digital services. Several Identity Management (IDM) systems are developed to cope with identity effectively, nonetheless, existing IDM systems have some limitations corresponding to identity and its management such as sovereignty, storage and access control, security, privacy and safeguarding, all of which require further improvement. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging IDM system which incorporates several required features to ensure that identity is sovereign, secure, reliable and generic. It is an evolving IDM system, thus it is essential to analyse its various features to determine its effectiveness in coping with the dynamic requirements of identity and its current challenges. This paper proposes numerous governing principles of SSI to analyse any SSI ecosystem and its effectiveness. Later, based on the proposed governing principles of SSI, it performs a comparative analysis of the two most popular SSI ecosystems uPort and Sovrin to present their effectiveness and limitations.},

The idea of constructing of a digital passport for each and every person in the world is not unique, but with the growing interest and progress of distributed ledgers, a new way of dealing with existing problems appeared. On the other hand, in our point of view, a lot of development groups are working in parallel on the similar topics, yet it is not clear what is going on inside. In this paper we will try to deﬁne the diﬀerences and discuss both pros and cons of using such commonly known technologies as Sovrin based upon the Hyperledger Indy technology, Civic, Jolocom, uPort and some others. Besides, we’ll tackle the idea of using the SSI for inanimate object and how it can be constructed in this way.},

First, we summarize eHealth identity management scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the existing decentralized identity management solutions and present decentralized identity models. In addition, we discuss the current decentralized identity projects and identify new challenges based on the existing solutions and the limitations when applying it to healthcare as a particular use case.},

	abstract = {Due to the exponential rise of the Internet in the last two decades, the digital presence has seen an enormous increase. Today, billions of people, devices and objects are digitally connected making the interactions much easier than before. To securely establish this connectivity in the digital era, proving digital identities has become crucial. Due to this, a growing number of organizations are building solutions that establish, verify and manage digital identities. Yet, a solution whereby digital identities and their associated data are efficiently managed is still far from being achieved. To fully understand the reason behind this lack, this paper provides a detailed state of the art related to identity management systems. It overviews traditional systems, analyses their strengths and limitations. This work highly focuses on the novel decentralized identity systems based on blockchain; a complete study describing their architecture, components, lifecycle and workflow is detailed. Additionally, solutions enabling decentralized identity are discussed, analysed and compared according to the ten principles of self-sovereign identity. Lastly, the challenges hindering the shift toward the fully decentralized identity paradigm are discussed.},

Some of them are built upon blockchain technology as this already provides decentralized persistent data and consensus. We will explore the emerging landscape of SelfSovereign Identity solutions and dissect their implementations under multiple aspect criteria to determine the necessity of blockchain technology in this ﬁeld.

However, there is a lack of systematic architecture designs for blockchain-based SSI systems to support methodical development. An aspect of such gap is demonstrated in current solutions, which are considered coarse grained and may increase data security risks. In this paper, we ﬁrst identify the lifecycles of three major SSI objects (i.e., key, identiﬁer, and credential) and present ﬁne-grained design patterns critical for application development. These patterns are associated with particular state transitions, providing a systematic view of system interactions and serving as a guidance for effective use of these patterns. Further, we present an SSI platform architecture, which advocates the notion of Design-Pattern-as-a-Service. Each design pattern serves as an API by wrapping the respective pattern code to ease application development and improve scalability and security. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on feasibility and scalability.},

Blockchain is an enabling technology for building self-sovereign identity systems by providing a neutral and trustable storage and computing infrastructure, and can be viewed as a component of the systems. Both blockchain and self-sovereign identity are emerging technologies which could present a steep learning curve for architects. We collect and propose 12 design patterns for blockchainbased self-sovereign identity systems to help the architects understand and easily apply the concepts in system design. Based on the lifecycles of three main objects involved in self-sovereign identity, we categorise the patterns into three groups: key management patterns, decentralised identifier management patterns, and credential design patterns. The proposed patterns provide a systematic and holistic guide for architects to design the architecture of blockchainbased self-sovereign identity systems.},

Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues, such as enabling mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms. Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate.

	abstract = {With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes. In this research we will explore the possibility of self-sovereign identity, where you are in control of your digital identity. We started with a desk research on currently available identity man agement solutions. We concluded that in most systems, the end-user is not able to store their own data. Currently only one decentralized system is available, but has not gained wide adoption yet. A case study has been performed on a solution which allows the ex change of KYC attributes, resulting from thorough Customer Due Dili gence (CDD) as is often performed when opening a bank account. These attributes can be used by other entities, like insurance companies and mortgage lenders to make their on-boarding process easier for customers, since they don't need to supply copies of the same documentation all over again. Also, the companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) this way to lower costs and make fewer errors. Al though the idea is very interesting, the studied solution did not meet the expectations. At the time the company behind the solution was very small and the process to improve very complex. The solution was also propri etary, creating dependence on the vendor, which heightens the adoption barrier. Because of the lessons learned from the case study, the results of the literature research and the desk research, we designed an architecture for a Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) using the concept of claim-based identity and blockchain technology. To lower adoption barriers and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, it will be developed on a public blockchain and source code will be made open-source. The solution will be privacy-friendly by using privacy-enhancing techniques and storing only claims about one's identity. We also provide a solution to allow retrieval of more sensitive data, and made it as modular as possible to make integration within existing IT architecture easier. The Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) can be use ful in a wide range of use cases, like proving your age when buying liquor at the supermarket or applying for a health insurance where you get a student discount if you can show your are enrolled at a university. This shows that our work resulted in a solid foundation for self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {The self-sovereign identity management model emerged with the rise of blockchain technology. This paradigm focuses on user-centricity and strives to place the user in full control of the digital identity. Numerous implementations embrace the self-sovereign identity concept, leading to a fragmented landscape of solutions. At the same time, traditional identity and access management protocols are largely disregarded and facilities to issue veriﬁable claims as attributes are not available. Therefore, service providers barely adopt these solutions. We propose a component-based architecture for integrating selfsovereign identity solutions into web applications to foster their adoption by service providers. Furthermore, we outline a sample implementation as a gateway that enables uPort and Jolocom for authentication, via the OpenID Connect protocol, as well as the retrieval of email address attestations for these solutions.},

	abstract = {Blockchains offer a decentralized, immutable and verifiable ledger that can record transactions of digital assets, provoking a radical change in several innovative scenarios, such as smart cities, eHealth or eGovernment. However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS.},

	abstract = {After introducing key concepts and definitions in the field of digital identity, this paper will investigate the benefits and drawbacks of existing identity systems on the road towards achieving self-sovereign identity. It will explore, in particular, the use of blockchain technology and biometrics as a means to ensure the “unicity” and “singularity” of identities, and the associated challenges pertaining to the security and confidentiality of personal information. The paper will then propose a model of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity based on attestations, claims, credentials and permissions, which is globally portable across the life of an individual. Such a system is not dependent on any particular government or organization for administration or legitimacy, although it might include government issued identification and biometrics as one of many indicia of identity. Such a solution based on a recorded and signed digital history of actions is a system that best approximates the fluidity and granularity of identity, enabling individuals to express only specific facets of their identity, depending on the parties with whom they wish to interact. This paper focuses on two case studies to explain how such a credentials system could work in specific contexts: (1) Kiva’s identity protocol for building credit history in Sierra Leone, and (2) World Food Programme’s Building Blocks program for delivering cash aid to refugees in Jordan. Finally, the paper will explore what the future might look like when blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and self-sovereign identity intersect. With digital transactions functioning as identity claims within an ecosystem based on self-sovereign identity, new business models might emerge, such as identity insurance schemes, along with the emergence of value-stable cryptocurrencies (“stablecoins”) functioning as local currencies.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the role of digital identities for a functioning digital economy and outlines requirements for their management. So far, no approach for the management of digital identities has been widely established, which leads to a fragmentation of ID services as well as a variety of user accounts. Due to the lack of standards, the interoperability of digital identities is also limited. This leads to several problems that prevent the efﬁcient and secure handling of digital identities. The concept of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and the associated standards “Veriﬁable Credentials” and “Decentralized Identiﬁers” is a promising approach to improve the situation. They allow the ﬂexible exchange of tamper-proof digital proofs between users and systems. Therefore, they form the foundation for building trust relationships in the digital space. This paper introduces the SSI paradigm and discusses the barriers that prevent the wide-scale adoption of this concept. With that, the reader gets a compact overview of different approaches for identity management and the potentials of self-sovereign identities. For the design of digital services in business and administration, this approach should be given greater attention to beneﬁt from the associated advantages.},

	abstract = {In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an inﬂuential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the ﬁrst-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned ﬂows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the ﬁrst formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.},
